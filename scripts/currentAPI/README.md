# currentAPI.js

CtrlAltStudio's modified version of High Fidelity's original currentAPI.js script that writes the API to the program log (i.e., 
prior to the UI being added).

Modifications:
- ESLint.
- Ignore Qt functions.
- List top-level objects.
- List build version.
- Code switch to list root items only.
