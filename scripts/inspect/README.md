# inspect.js

CtrlAltStudio's modified version of High Fidelity's inspect.js script.

Modifications:
- Leave camera where it is when release Alt key.
- Restore camera to default position when press Esc key or move avatar.
- Make camera control start immediately rather than having a 0.5s delay at the start.
- Add ability to orbit about a point in space if no object intersects mouse click.
